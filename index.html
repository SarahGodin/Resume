    <p>
      Hello my name is Sarah Godin. I am from Chakastaypasin Band Cree Nation in
      Saskatchewan. I currently reside in Edmonton Alberta. Thank you for
      viewing my page. I am currently looking for a full time employment with a
      Digital Art company. Whilst in the IndigiTech program, I had the
      opportunity to work on a few projects using the Krita, Figma applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I was able to create a webpage for an artist named Summer
      Tweenish. This was suppose to help promote her art increase visibility
      help her with bookings.
    </p>
